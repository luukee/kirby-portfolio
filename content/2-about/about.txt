I grew up with my three siblings on my parents farm in Missouri. The farm was a  lot of fun, but I realized I like making things happen on computers.

So here we are today, you are reading this while I'm building (or learning) something on my laptop. Either in my garage or in my kitchen :)

You can contact me through this form, although I prefer you email me at lukecarlhartman@gmaildotcom. Or you can (link: http://lukecarlhartman.com/hire-me text:submit a web development request here). Thanks!!
