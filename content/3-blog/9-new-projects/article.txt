KiiTO is a Venice CA. plant based health conscious, superfood wellness, coconut water drink business that I took on December 21, 2018. They had a web developer start on their Shopify store, but they were unresponsive :( so they brought me on! 

I finished the site in 3 main areas. The product display on the (link: https://drinkkiito.com/collections/shop text: shop page target:"_blank"), the (link: https://rechargepayments.com/ text: ReCharge app target:"_blank") configuration and styling the cart & checkout. Using the Shopify Liquid code, CSS and Javascript. So far, it's been good. I see sales coming in all the time!!!
